# Solar System Simulation

This is a simple solar system simulation using Pygame. The program simulates the motion of planets around the Sun based on Newtonian gravity.

## Features
- Simulates the gravitational attraction between celestial bodies.
- Implements real-world astronomical units and time steps.
- Uses Pygame for graphical visualization.

## Running the Simulation
Execute the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python solar_system.py
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Notes
- The simulation uses a basic numerical integration method to approximate planetary orbits.
- The background image file (`space.png`) and planet images (e.g., `earth32.png`, `sun.png`) must be present in the same directory as the script.
